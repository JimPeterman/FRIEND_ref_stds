# Reference Standards for Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF)

These projects involve the creation of reference standards for cardiorespiratory fitness from the database FRIEND (Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise National Database).  The reference standards help clinicians and exercise physiologists interpret an individual's measured CRF values by providing context of what a normal CRF is for an individual of the same sex and age. 

Information about FRIEND can be found [HERE](https://jimpeterman-friend-app-app-m9w2iq.streamlitapp.com/) on a web app I created to help raise awareness about the project.

## Updating CRF Reference Standards for Healthy Individuals.
For this project, I led the creation of reference standards for CRF in apparently healthy individuals. These reference standards were an update from previous standards - they included additional data from additional labs/clinics throughout the US. This project was one of my first projects using Python. I created summary tables as well as figures to illustrate trends in the data. The results were subsequently published in the [Mayo Clinic Proceedings journal](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00645-5/fulltext).


## CRF Reference Standards for Individuals with Cardiovascular Disease (CVD).
Individuals with CVD typically have CRF values that are much lower than their apparently healthy peers. Thus, to accurately understand their health status, I led this project in creating reference standards for CRF for individuals with CVD. I used R to create summary tables across different disease states, statistically compared the CRF across different disease states, and created figures to illustrate trends in the data. I subsequently summarized the findings for publication. The results can be found in the [Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.022336).
