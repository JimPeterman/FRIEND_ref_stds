# Updating Normalized Reference Standards for Cardiorespiratory Fitness

For this project, I led the creation of reference standards for cardiorespiratory fitness from the database FRIEND (Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise National Database). The results were subsequently published in the [Mayo Clinic Proceedings journal](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00645-5/fulltext) and are used by clinicians and exercise physiologists across the United States.
